### [John Cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage): “The first question I ask myself when something doesn't seem to be beautiful is why do I think it's not beautiful. And very shortly you discover that there is no reason.”

I am not professionally trained in music, while the most important reason why I keep trying is that I enjoy it. I play the piano since I was young, but I find singing more addicting as for now.

### J-pop 

The language of Japanese always holds a special place in my heart. The music that I like, both tranditional and popular, has a deep correlation to the Shinto religion and a very realistic depiction of the [Japan’s Salaryman Culture](https://medium.com/@jami3jam/the-japanese-salaryman-452692b485e5). I like to remind myself that there are people suffering internally no matter how glamorous their lives may seem, but the hope they hold on can be a great motivation for gratitude and reflection.

### Participation in the University of New Haven Ensemble

 Special thanks to my vocal professor Terri Lane, a great advocate for students with difficult backgrounds, a great mentor, and a dear friend.
