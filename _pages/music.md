> The first question I ask myself when something doesn't seem to be beautiful is why do I think it's not beautiful. And very shortly you discover that there is no reason.

# J-pop 

![Salaryman](/images/salaryman.jpeg)

The language of Japanese always holds a special place in my heart. The music that I like, both tranditional and popular, is deeply embedded in the Shinto religion and a very realistic depiction of the [Japan’s Salaryman Culture](https://medium.com/@jami3jam/the-japanese-salaryman-452692b485e5). The antagonistic hope in the lyrics can be a great motivation for gratitude and reflection.
