I am a fourth year undergraduate student at [University of New Haven](https://www.newhaven.edu/) studying Mathematics with a Physics Minor. I am also an intern at [MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research](https://space.mit.edu/). I was born in Shenzhen, China, and I have been to school in Shenzhen (China), Longkou (China), Kobe (Japan), and the US.
