 <!-- I will be attending the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2024 to pursue a PhD degree in Astronomy and Astrophysics. I am also an intern at [Periemter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/) and [MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research](https://space.mit.edu/) doing astrophysics research. -->

### Here is a picture of me and my pup named Fermi at a dog show.
