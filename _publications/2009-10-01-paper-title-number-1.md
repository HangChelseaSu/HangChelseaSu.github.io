Single-atom photocatalysts (SAPCs) have attracted great interests due to their remarkable atom utilization effi- ciency, excellent activity, and selectivity, yet no application in synchronous biorefinery and water splitting. Here, efficient SAPCs based on atomically dispersed Zn atoms on carbon nitride (named ZnmCN) were produced. Experiments verified that ZnmCN has widened adsorption range of visible-light and lowered ability of elec- tronhole recombination, leading to excellent photocatalytic redox activity for synchronous biorefinery and water splitting to co-produce lactic acid (selectivity up to 91.0%) and hydrogen (~15898.8 μmol g1 h1). This system has excellent universality for small- molecule monosaccharides and macromolecular xylan. Poisoning experiments showed that hþ, 1O2, ⋅O2 and ⋅OH can promote the simultaneous production of lactic acid and hydrogen. This work realized full utilization of whole redox reaction and provided a novel strategy for efficient and concomitant production of hydrogen and value-added chemicals from biomass-derived feedstocks aqueous solutions.
